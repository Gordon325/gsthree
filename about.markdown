# Gordon Smith

Hello! I'm Gordon, I am from Spokane Washington where I live with my wife and daughter. I am a designer with an emphasis on UX design. I enjoy UX because it allows me to utilize many aspects of design. Everything from research, to layout, to development is encompassed in UX and that is what has pushed me in this direction. 

During my personal time I love spending time with my family going on outdoor adventures. We love going snowboarding and kayaking, and I enjoy skateboarding and playing hockey. We are new to the active lifestyle and are loving every minute of it, and enjoy knowing that we are showing our daughter what the world can offer.
